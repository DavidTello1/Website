intro: I started playing video games when I was a kid, so they have been a huge part of my past. As I grew older I joined the video games industry, aiming to create experiences that would touch the future of other people like me. I have a lot of fun doing what I do because every day is a new challenge and I am constantly pushing my creativity!
outro: I mainly program in C/C++ and I am also familiar with C# and Python. I use Unity sometimes, but I code most of my personal projects without a game engine. I am especially interested in the gameplay and game AI fields since they allow me to be a bit of a designer too.
